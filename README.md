# matplotscripts

Scripts to auto-generate matplotlib graphs

These scripts were used to generate the graphs for the paper
[Seamless MANO of multi-vendor SDN controllers across federated multi-domains](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2020.107752),
co-authored by me.

With little effort, the scripts can be modified for your own needs, and to plot your own graphs.
