# Matplotlib Scripts

Scripts to auto-generate matplotlib graphs

## Description

These scripts were made to generate the graphs for the paper
[Seamless MANO of multi-vendor SDN controllers across federated multi-domains](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2020.107752),
co-authored by me.

With some effort, the scripts could be modified for your own needs, and to plot your own graphs.
